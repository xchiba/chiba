is a super cool browser that is able to make you go back in time, you can see all your favorite sites created from 1994 to 2005. isn't it so cool?
all of this is based on theoldnet.com, in fact you could go directly there, but it is not the same experience, now you have a fucking browser that looks like a normal browser of the 90s but fuck you can go back in time, I'm shocked holy fuck.
